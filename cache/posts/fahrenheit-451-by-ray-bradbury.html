<p>A lighter read than other distopian future society classics like 1984 and Brave New World.</p>
<p>Unlike these, it does much less emphasis in the technicalities of the nature of the distopian world the plot unfolds in and centers more on exposing the message of a society deeply slaved by entertainment, with no capacity to question its path.</p>
<p>It exposes how &quot;happiness&quot; in these circumstances is unreal and &quot;freedom&quot; is nothing more than a tool on other forms on authoritarism.</p>
