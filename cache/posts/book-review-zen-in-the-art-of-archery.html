<p>Archery and fencing are the two disciplines this book uses to expose Zen buddhism's practices and nature.</p>
<p>It does so with the simple narrative of the author's journey in mastering archery through &quot;art without artifice&quot;.</p>
<p>This means learning the act of shooting an arrow to become as natural, unconscious and effortless as an apple falling from from a tree.</p>
<p>It works very well as the tool to expose the methods and philosophy behind it, which then parallels to any skill or discipline we can set for ourselves.</p>
<p>The main skill to learn being, rather than the actual physical skill of shooting arrows, learning to detach ourselves from the objective and allowing &quot;it&quot; (the unconscious) to take the reins.</p>
