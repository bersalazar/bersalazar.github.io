<p>Dr. Jekyll found in Mr. Hyde freedom from the restrictions of his life as a scientist and as a member of the high society.</p>
<p>It was not necessarilly for being discontent with any of them, but simply because our minds are multifacetic and complex.</p>

<p>And as in many cases, the person ends up in disgrace when the mind succumbs to these and loses control.</p>
