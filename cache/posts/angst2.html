<p>That anguish that burns on exhalation and keeps you observing the infinite, from time to time. It's not always there, much less at this age, but it comes quite often.</p>
<p>It happened to me today after reading in all my available media the news about Monica Spear. I knew her name, but if you asked me before today, I'd have said she's famous, but that's it. Not much from that I'd been able to say.</p>
<p>She was murdered in a robbery. Something that nowadays venezuelans hear and go: &quot;Fuck, that's a shame...&quot;, but that's it. Quickly interpreted, assimilated, digested and forgotten. Regular stuff.</p>
<p>Afterwards come the details: &quot;Her car broke on the highway&quot;. There's where things get complicated. It's a bit tougher to swallow. Then you read on and notice she was with her husband and daughter. That her husband was also murdered. That her daughter got shot in the leg. That now she's an orphan. That they lived in Miami and were in Venezuela on vacation.</p>
<p>One slap after the other.</p>
<p>It's funny to think how the government, in the face of these news, must be feeling like having caught a break. In ther eagerness to create smoke curtains to deviate attention from their incompetence, this news becomes a lifeline which helps them turn the ongoing economic debate into the postergable and manageable debate around crime.</p>
<p>Evidently, the media exploded. The death of a gorgeous, ex beauty queen, who had a public life in latinamerica's show business, and adding to that the crudeness of the crime itself and the current political status, is quite shocking. Her last Instagram publication, riding a horse in Apure's plain fields like an Amazon, tossing kisses. Classic cinema stuff there.</p>
<p>That acid ball that forms in the gut when thinking of the family's circumstance. They were moving through a road I've passed multiple times, with a similar car and totally alone.</p>
<p>It's clich√© to say it could have happened to my wife and me, which could only generate fear. The anguish absorbs me when thinking of the little time I've got left in this distorted country and on the many chances left of falling in the impune and impartial darkness called 'hampa'.</p>
