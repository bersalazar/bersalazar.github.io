<p>I found out about this book thanks to Derek Sivers' blog. It's his highest rated book, and was really interested in it after reading its premise.</p>
<p>It's in a short story format, each of them with a version explaining what happens after we die. They're very creative and packed with analogies to philosophical thought or existentialist proposals that don't necessarily change or get resolved after we die.</p>
<p>God is often humanised, heaven is often treated as a mundane society filled with similar vices that we endure during life and the afterlife is sometimes a multi-dimensional, uncontrollable and even insignificant existence.</p>
