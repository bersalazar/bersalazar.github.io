<p>Archery and fencing are the two disciplines this book uses to explain Zen buddhism's practices and nature.</p>
<p>It does so with the simple narrative. The author's journey into mastering archery through &quot;art without artifice&quot;. This means learning the act of shooting an arrow to become as natural, unconscious and effortless as an apple that falls from a tree. This practice works very well as a driver to the methods and philosophy behind it, which then parallels to any skill or discipline we can set for ourselves.</p>
<p>In short, the main goal is not entirely about learningto shoot arrows with precision, rather creating the habit or achieving the meta-skill of detaching ourselves from the objective when learning something and allowing &quot;it&quot; (the unconscious) to take the reins of the actions.</p>
