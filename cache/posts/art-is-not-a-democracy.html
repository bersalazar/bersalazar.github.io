<p>I recently saw an interview with George R.R. Martin and learned how art should not be a democracy. He was asked if his fans influence his writing at any point. He replied 'not so much' but the subtext was  'absolutely not.'</p>
<p>He explained how sickening it is for an artist –in this case a writer– in Hollywood when audiovisual arts are treated as a product. Everything has to be tested and adapted so it has traction within a certain audience, a certain market. An artist is not free in this context. It is not possible to express your own artistic intuition when external factors are constantly routing your decisions or your finalized work.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I've stopped trusting awards in any form of art. Their intention may be to project artistry but suffer the consequence of a corporative, business-driven mentality. Why are they given out yearly? Why is an acting category split in gender while a writing or directing category is not? In order to be sold as a product, a piece of art's quality has to be measured in order to reduce the public's uncertainty of investing time and money in them. Awards provide this certainty.</p>
<p>However, in their pure artistic form, some films, recordings, paintings or books do not become relevant until they've passed the test of time; until they've been digested individually and culturally. Some works aren't relevant in the time they're released but much years later. And even in a more pure form, art may not be meant to be appreciated by a mass audience. It may not be meant for a public consensus. Some forms of it are just an expression that exists and should be appreciated for what they are, nothing more.</p>
