<p>Not only an excellent read, but a complete experience.</p>
<p>While reading about our origins and reasons behind our behaviours as individuals and as societies, I couldn’t help constantly thinking to myself: &quot;well, that makes total sense.&quot;</p>
<p>We’re hard-wired by our collective knowledge, slaves to our self-created imagined orders, thinking and believing in the rules the human species has set out across generations past.</p>
<p>They have come organically as a consequence of progress, technology and our need for expansion.</p>
<p>This book shows the biological and completely objective reasons behind culture, ideology, technology, happiness, decisions, and makes a very strong case of what our future might look like.</p>
<p>It’s worth every chapter and I’m looking forward to reading Homo Deus.</p>
