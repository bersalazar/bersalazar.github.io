<p>Great storytelling. Very concise plot that manages to cover many different subjects.</p>
<p>Desires, loyalty, compassion, fear, anger, discrimination and regret. Every character is richly developed.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s very easy to follow their intentions and desires with few dialogues and a lot of subtext, even if their involvement within the story is short.</p>
<p>And it does so with every chapter starting with beautiful descriptions of the natural environment that surrounds them, and which lead transitions into the plot.</p>
<p>It's a tale about injustice prevailing even when hopes and dreams lie in small things.</p>
