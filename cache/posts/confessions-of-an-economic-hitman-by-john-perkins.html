<p>I'm not 100% bought on the veracity of the facts detailed in this book, which may be due to the narrative, but these are definitely deep insights about modern imperialism in the form of confessions.</p>
<p>Which end up making more sense than expected.</p>
<p>Worth a read for those that are skeptic of intentions behind 'good acts'.</p>
