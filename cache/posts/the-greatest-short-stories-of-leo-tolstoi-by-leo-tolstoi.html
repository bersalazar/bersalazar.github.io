<p>There are no evil characters is Tolstoy's short stories, only actions (or lack there of) that leads them in the wrongful paths.</p>
<p>Most of the stories set up scenarios where, through compassion, care for others and selflessness, people achieve true happiness, or, in Tolstoy's eyes, &quot;they find God&quot;</p>
<p>From my point of view this means finding joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And as narrated in &quot;Ivan the fool&quot; or in &quot;Two old men&quot;, it's not usually the traditionally known path, but the one where the characters have surrendered selfish desires or simply have stopped caring about leading lives according to external factors.</p>
