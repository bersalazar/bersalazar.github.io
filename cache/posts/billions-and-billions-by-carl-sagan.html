<p>A journey into Carl Sagan's &quot;shower thoughts&quot;.</p>
<p>A compilation of his opinions on multiple subjects, from the origin of the universe, life, the human being, society and mostly on our permanent shortsightedness on our future as a species.</p>
<p>I found intriguing his ability to abstract the usually complex scientific knowledge into understandable and relatable text, in which we can realize how insignificant human life is when compared to Earth's history, let alone the universe's.</p>
<p>&quot;Human beings have just arrived here, barely a few million years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>The last chapter and epilogue is the sad but hopeful last note of a truly remarkable human: his final journey into the unknown.</p>
