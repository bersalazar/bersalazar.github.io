<p>Absolutely enjoyed this jewel of a book, specially the first half. It analyzes our patterns and behavior when we set goals for ourselves.</p>
<p>We've been taught to focus on objectives if we want something meaningful out of life. We measure our worthiness through grades, medals, records.</p>
<p>We become stressed and judgemental in the process - consciously or unconsciously - and ultimately frustrated when we unfairly compare ourselves to top levels, and end up giving up.</p>
<p>What we haven't been taught is to find reward in the process. This allows us to find fulfilment in any step of any objective that can otherwise be considered 'difficult'.</p>
<p>It reliefs us from the tension and stress that becomes a distracting factor from being in the present moment.</p>
<p>It seems like a paradox, the more we focus on the process and detach ourselves from the desired goal, the quicker and more efficiently our minds can progress, because the things slowing us down are mostly fictitious, self-imposed pressures and expectations.</p>
