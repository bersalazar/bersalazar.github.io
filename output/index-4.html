<p>This was incredibly inspiring. A journey of self-discovery and a mild introduction to eastern philosophy. Moreover, it's a beautifully phrased, entertaining prose.</p>
<p>Siddharta starts out strongly. He's confident and seemingly incredibly wise for his age. While he's born in the highest rank of India's social caste and already in a culture of devotion to the mind and body — which makes him seem like he's already set up to be the spiritual compass of the story — he's also rebellious of them. He wants something else. He's a seeker.</p>
<p>This takes him on a journey of exploration and discovery of desires and vices of what's referred to as the "child people"; experiencing abandonment, lust, wealth, greed or by ceding to the often irrational, instinctive feelings that would come from parenthood. He meets and learns from multiple characters that shape him and who are shaped by him.</p>
<p>One of my favourite lessons comes from his meeting with Kamala, in a period when learning the art of love. She asks him: "What skills do you have?" Siddharta, who's never done skilled labor, replies: "I can fast, I can wait and I can think." While seemingly worthless in a world that values status, wealth and material possessions, Siddharta's self-discipline, patience and wisdom grant him they keys to opening all doors for achieving his goals.</p>
<p>"You see, Kamala, when you throw a stone into the water, it hurries by the swiftest possible path to the bottom. It is like this when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolve. He does nothing — he waits, he thinks, he fasts — but he passes through the things of this world like a stone through water, without doing anything, without moving; he is drawn and lets himself fall."</p>

<img alt="/images/sunset.png" src="images/sunset.png"><p>A feeling of burn on exhalation. A long gaze into the infinite.</p>
<p>It comes from time to time. Not always there, but not shy of often stopping by.</p>
<p>Last time it came after watching the news. A murdered celebrity. A mediatic explosion.</p>
<p>I knew her name, but wasn't paying much attention these days. I just knew she had fame.</p>
<p>An innocent ride of a long, bumpy road. A vicious habit of meeting subsistence by harming others.</p>
<p>The numb crowd fully domesticated. We had become comformist dystopia.</p>
<p>Experts at shrugging away horror and inconvenience. Quick to interpret, digest and forget.</p>
<p>Along with details the first drops of gut acid. A creeping burn at the base of it.</p>
<p>A familiar road. A murdered mate. A child with a permanent wound and an eternal loss.</p>
<p>It's one slap after the other.</p>
<p>How much we have lost by riding on the back of tyrants?</p>
<p>How little have we been taught to value life?</p>
<p>She said goodbye with a few kisses and a sunset background.</p>
<p>And with that, the acid ball became whole. The burn had moved around like a metastasized tumor.</p>
<p>Time became small, distortion became evident and thoughts of falling to the impune darkness became the only ones in my mind.</p>

<p>A book that showcases Adlerian psychology and philosophy, written in the form of a conversation between an old philosopher and a young, angry and frustrated disciple, who's facing disappointment from being an spectator of his unchanging and unfulfilling life. It works very well as the philosopher's arguments are developed, the disciple's point of view is intended to be a projection of the reader's doubts, concerns and biased opinions.</p>
<p>Lifestyle is the tendencies of thoughts and actions in our life. One of the strongest arguments in the book is that, at all times, we're in full control of steering our lifestyle. This is because it's a subjective interpretation of the world around us and being so, we can change it. Lifestyle is not really an objective fact. It's how we view, accept and relate to things and people. And that's always within our control.</p>
<p>It argues that the root of our frustrations and feelings of inferiority always come from interpersonal relationships and their dynamics. Failure to obtain goals, supposed traumas and feelings of incompleteness are not consequence of past experiences, on the contrary, past experiences are subjective tools we use in the present to justify those feelings.</p>
<p>It touches on 'separating tasks', which means dealing only with actions, thoughts and feelings that are within our control and nothing else. By exercising this, we can achieve freedom. This will come when we learn to avoid basing our lives, actions, feelings on the actual cause of imprisonment of our minds, the one thing that keeps away from freedom: the desire for recognition.</p>
