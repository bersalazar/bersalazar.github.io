<p>"Humans are not wired to be consistently wired"</p>
<p>An easy read for those interested in habits of de-cluttering our life and efficiently using modern tools, and an eye-opening read for those unaware of how much attention is stolen by digital entertainment,
social media and mobile technology.</p>
<p>It reminisces of social and personal behaviors from before the modern smartphone era, and its benefits. It doesn't promote a complete divorce from technology, instead it strongly argues for a more efficient use while providing insights and practical options to achieve it.</p>
<p>Some of the more relevant subjects: solitude as a form of liberation, the value of "high-quality leisure", the difference in value between non-digital, real life conversations and digital connections, or how the author refers to them, high and low-bandwith communication.</p>
<p>Time is unconsciously taken for granted. It's the most valuable commodity we own and the one thing tech giants are eager to take from us. As these tools are more and more invasive of our day-to-day and designed towards attracting our eyeballs, it becomes harder to develop habits for more focused, fulfilled minds and more valuable interactions.</p>

<p>A deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.</p>
<p>Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: "Optimism", "Unsustainable", "The Spark" and "The Evolution of Culture".</p>
<p>The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.</p>
<p>A special mention to the "A Dream of Socrates" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works.</p>

</div>
<p>Saramago's style is not conventional but it's illuminating. It made me understand that blocks of dialogue, chapter titles, character names and even usual punctuation rules aren't requirement to convey a thrilling and smooth narrative.</p>
<p>The first part details the unusual way in which a town organically comes together to put its government and democractic system on the tip of its toes, in the least conventional but evident: through vote.</p>
<p>The rest is an essay on the effects of this premise. The clumsy and improvised attempts from the government of keeping its power quota, to which it's blindly convinced it's entitled to. Then the town's actions in collective rebellion, which are so perfectly and organically synchronized that they manage to set in motion the repressive and dictatorial machinery of a government with a democratic front but essentially autocratic.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the story is narrated from the collective point of of view of both the town and the government. Then it focuses on specific characters and on how they react to each other's actions.
With emphasis on cabinet members, but then focus on a police commissar with the task of finding the source, real or fabricated, of the discontent.
This leads him on a journey of finding his own clarity, after being exposed to the truth and individual justice. In my opinion it shows that the root of a rebellion are in our principles, and they're spread through small actions, more than propaganda or grand scale rhetoric.</p>

<p>Archery and fencing are the two disciplines this book uses to explain Zen buddhism's practices and nature.</p>
<p>It does so with the simple narrative. The author's journey into mastering archery through "art without artifice". This means learning the act of shooting an arrow to become as natural, unconscious and effortless as an apple that falls from a tree. This practice works very well as a driver to the methods and philosophy behind it, which then parallels to any skill or discipline we can set for ourselves.</p>
<p>In short, the main goal is not entirely about learningto shoot arrows with precision, rather creating the habit or achieving the meta-skill of detaching ourselves from the objective when learning something and allowing "it" (the unconscious) to take the reins of the actions.</p>

<p>Rarely have I felt the need to constantly catch my focus in order to follow what I was reading. I didn't know what to expect from this book and only after the first chapters did I realize there's no plot or narrative, only reflections and deep philosophical descriptions. With little room for structure, Thoreau describes his presence, at times in painfully long detail, of his days secluded from society in the Walden pond.</p>
<p>It's a strong manifestation of mindfulness and 'being'. He allows his mind to ramble on what he sees, hears or feels, alongside reflections about society, life and the nature of the human being, colored with references to history, books he's read or parallels with stories from his experience. Many times I found myself lost in the text, but also constantly found myself striking true gems of wisdom, fulfilling thoughts and very relatable passages.</p>
<p>Notable chapters: Reading, House-warming and Solitude.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the book, the 21st century’s superpower is simply to have the ability to focus.</p>
<p>Mastery of a skill can only come from a sustained and persistent state of distraction-less concentration.</p>
<p>Instead, we're fostering (and living in) a culture of constant distraction, dressed up as "productive" behavior.</p>
<p>It's a culture where visible busyness is valued as productivity, and it's due to a current troublesome relationship with technology, referred to in this book as "technopoly".</p>
<p>We're biased to social media and instant messaging as tools where it's a given, where it's normal, that they should receive our constant attention.</p>
<p>What we end up with is a lack of depth in the work we do. We focus on the shallow ends of work, such as reading and instantly replying to email and messages, making a habit in our minds to be "always available" for an interruption of a flow state.</p>
<p>It makes a strong case towards the usefulness and true nature of “leisure” time. When not sleeping and when not focused on a task, our mind doesn’t seek “rest” or what we understand as relaxation like watching TV or scrolling through social media. What our minds are constantly seeking is fulfillment, which can be achieved with well-structured and meaningful leisure time.</p>
<p>One of the sections I enjoyed the most talks about approaching our jobs and careers with a "craftsman" philosophy. Historically, to "follow your passion" is motivated by the flawed idea that what matters most for our careers is the specifics of the job we choose, where in reality, the meaning uncovered by day to day efforts on any job or career comes building and applying the skills required for it (hopefully into mastery) and doesn't consider the end-goal or the outcome as the source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"A wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be."</p>
<p>These are not novel concepts and in this book they’re presented with insights and examples from our modern society and work habits.</p>
<p>It also presents specific techniques and offers useful references to other works that revolve around the same subject: developing the skill to enter a state of deep concentration while finding satisfaction in the process, not the outcome.</p>

<p>Absolutely enjoyed this jewel of a book, specially the first half. It analyzes our patterns and behavior when we set goals for ourselves.</p>
<p>We've been taught to focus on objectives if we want something meaningful out of life. We measure our worthiness through grades, medals, records.</p>
<p>We become stressed and judgemental in the process - consciously or unconsciously - and ultimately frustrated when we unfairly compare ourselves to top levels, and end up giving up.</p>
<p>What we haven't been taught is to find reward in the process. This allows us to find fulfilment in any step of any objective that can otherwise be considered 'difficult'.</p>
<p>It reliefs us from the tension and stress that becomes a distracting factor from being in the present moment.</p>
<p>It seems like a paradox, the more we focus on the process and detach ourselves from the desired goal, the quicker and more efficiently our minds can progress, because the things slowing us down are mostly fictitious, self-imposed pressures and expectations.</p>

<p>I expected a more practical approach. Instead, this book is a transformative experience in the way to approach learning, performing and ultimately enjoying music.</p>
<p>It's about learning to channel the artistic expression into mastery through meditation and self-awareness.</p>

<p>It can be an uphill path to introduce ourselves to stoics like Seneca or Marcus Aurelius, or philosophy in general, however Schopenhauer, even though his prose is somewhat technical, is definitely more suited for an inexperienced reader.</p>
<p>It breaks down subjects like happiness, wealth, pleasure, analyses boredom on an existential level and his take on its causes.</p>
<p>It also develops on concepts like "inward wealth", the types of pleasures, and how we are perceived by others, through honor and fame.</p>
<p>Some quotable quotes:</p>
<p>"The happiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we obtain from our surroundings"</p>
<p>"Men are not influenced by things, but by their thoughts about things"</p>
<p>"How much there is in the world I do not want"</p>
<p>It's hard to believe how works like this can be so fulfilling yet be so unknown.</p>
<p>After reading this mountain of intellect, I wonder how much we should benefit from its proper diffusion.</p>
<p>It's evidence of how much human nature was figured out way before our modern generations.</p>

<p>"One man may be more cunning than another, but not more cunning than everybody else."</p>
<p>A Benjamin Franklin quote that aptly summarizes this little jewel of a book.</p>
<p>Successful investing is much less about skilfully reading and beating the market in short bursts of savvy, and essentially much more about focusing on the entire market with patience, discipline and common sense.</p>
<p>The game ends up being easier to play than expected.</p>
<p>It's the next step after reading and applying the techniques from "financial peace" books like Dave Ramsey, Andrew Tobias or The Barefoot Investor, as it dives deeper in detail of the "growth" phase that all these have in common.</p>
