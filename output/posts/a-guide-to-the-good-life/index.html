<p>It takes a certain frame of mind and the experiences that come with age to embrace stoicism as a philosophy for life.</p>
<p>This book is an introduction and, moreover, a practical guide. It’s a well paced and informative piece. It discusses many of the common questions and skepticism that arises when reading or adopting a stoic life.</p>
<p>It’s a base for those unaware of its principles and it's certainly a first step on the path of discovery and understanding the work of great thinkerslike Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca. It's filled with insights on how to balance stoic behaviors, ideas and patterns with our day-to-day.</p>
<p>Personally, it's one of the most quotable books I’ve ever read. I found myself making annotations on almost every page. I do feel, however, that it makes for a better experience if whoever reads it can relate to the subjects and stoicism in general on a personal level.</p>
<p>These days people may rarely see the need to adopt a philosophy for life. Instead, we spend our days working with the goal of affording the latest consumer gadget. We resolute to believe that if we buy enough, we will have a life both meaningful and maximally fulfilling. These, instead, tend to lead to a life plagued with anger, anxiety, fear, grief and envy, which for stoicism, will not be a good life.</p>
