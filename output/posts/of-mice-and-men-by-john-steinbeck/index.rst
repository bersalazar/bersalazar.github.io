Great storytelling. Very concise plot that manages to cover many different subjects. 

Desires, loyalty, compassion, fear, anger, discrimination and regret. Every character is richly developed. 

Itâ€™s very easy to follow their intentions and desires with few dialogues and a lot of subtext, even if their involvement within the story is short. 

And it does so with every chapter starting with beautiful descriptions of the natural environment that surrounds them, and which lead transitions into the plot.

It's a tale about injustice prevailing even when hopes and dreams lie in small things.
