Rarely have I felt the need to constantly catch my focus in order to follow what I was reading. I didn't know what to expect from this book and only after the first chapters did I realize there's no plot or narrative, only reflections and deep philosophical descriptions. With little room for structure, Thoreau describes his presence, at times in painfully long detail, of his days secluded from society in the Walden pond.

It's a strong manifestation of mindfulness and 'being'. He allows his mind to ramble on what he sees, hears or feels, alongside reflections about society, life and the nature of the human being, colored with references to history, books he's read or parallels with stories from his experience. Many times I found myself lost in the text, but also constantly found myself striking true gems of wisdom, fulfilling thoughts and very relatable passages.

Notable chapters: Reading, House-warming and Solitude.
