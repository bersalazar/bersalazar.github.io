A lighter read than other distopian future society classics like 1984 and Brave New World.

Unlike these, it does much less emphasis in the technicalities of the nature of the distopian world the plot unfolds in and centers more on exposing the message of a society deeply slaved by entertainment, with no capacity to question its path.

It exposes how "happiness" in these circumstances is unreal and "freedom" is nothing more than a tool on other forms on authoritarism.
