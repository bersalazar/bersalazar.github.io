<p>As mentioned in the book, the 21st century’s superpower is simply to have the ability to focus.</p>
<p>Mastery of a skill can only come from a sustained and persistent state of distraction-less concentration.</p>
<p>Instead, we're fostering (and living in) a culture of constant distraction, dressed up as "productive" behavior.</p>
<p>It's a culture where visible busyness is valued as productivity, and it's due to a current troublesome relationship with technology, referred to in this book as "technopoly".</p>
<p>We're biased to social media and instant messaging as tools where it's a given, where it's normal, that they should receive our constant attention.</p>
<p>What we end up with is a lack of depth in the work we do. We focus on the shallow ends of work, such as reading and instantly replying to email and messages, making a habit in our minds to be "always available" for an interruption of a flow state.</p>
<p>It makes a strong case towards the usefulness and true nature of “leisure” time. When not sleeping and when not focused on a task, our mind doesn’t seek “rest” or what we understand as relaxation like watching TV or scrolling through social media. What our minds are constantly seeking is fulfillment, which can be achieved with well-structured and meaningful leisure time.</p>
<p>One of the sections I enjoyed the most talks about approaching our jobs and careers with a "craftsman" philosophy. Historically, to "follow your passion" is motivated by the flawed idea that what matters most for our careers is the specifics of the job we choose, where in reality, the meaning uncovered by day to day efforts on any job or career comes building and applying the skills required for it (hopefully into mastery) and doesn't consider the end-goal or the outcome as the source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"A wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be."</p>
<p>These are not novel concepts and in this book they’re presented with insights and examples from our modern society and work habits.</p>
<p>It also presents specific techniques and offers useful references to other works that revolve around the same subject: developing the skill to enter a state of deep concentration while finding satisfaction in the process, not the outcome.</p>
