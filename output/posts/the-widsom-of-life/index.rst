It can be an uphill path to introduce ourselves to stoics like Seneca or Marcus Aurelius, or philosophy in general, however Schopenhauer, even though his prose is somewhat technical, is definitely more suited for an inexperienced reader.

It breaks down subjects like happiness, wealth, pleasure, analyses boredom on an existential level and his take on its causes. 

It also develops on concepts like "inward wealth", the types of pleasures, and how we are perceived by others, through honor and fame.

Some quotable quotes:

"The happiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we obtain from our surroundings"

"Men are not influenced by things, but by their thoughts about things"

"How much there is in the world I do not want"

It's hard to believe how works like this can be so fulfilling yet be so unknown. 

After reading this mountain of intellect, I wonder how much we should benefit from its proper diffusion. 

It's evidence of how much human nature was figured out way before our modern generations.
