This is not a how-to guide on DevOps and does not portray a realistic timeline for business change.

What it is, is a great resource to understand how the DevOps practices and areas impact business performance, by turning the complex terminology and concepts into a narrative.

Basically, if you are in a business that heavily relies on information technologies, operations and development, this is a great book for you.
