<p>It comes from time to time. Not always there, but not shy of often stopping by.</p>
<p>Last time it came after watching the news. A murdered celebrity. A mediatic explosion.</p>
<p>I knew her name, but wasn't paying much attention these days. I just knew she had fame.</p>
<p>An innocent ride of a long, bumpy road. A vicious habit of meeting subsistence by harming others.</p>
<p>The numb crowd fully domesticated. We had become comformist dystopia.</p>
<p>Experts at shrugging away horror and inconvenience. Quick to interpret, digest and forget.</p>
<p>Along with details the first drops of gut acid. A creeping burn at the base of it.</p>
<p>A familiar road. A murdered mate. A child with a permanent wound and an eternal loss.</p>
<p>It's one slap after the other.</p>
<p>How much we have lost by riding on the back of tyrants?</p>
<p>How little have we been taught to value life?</p>
<p>She said goodbye with a few kisses and a sunset background.</p>
<p>And with that, the acid ball became whole. The burn had moved around like a metastasized tumor.</p>
<p>Time became small, distortion became evident and thoughts of falling to the impune darkness became the only ones in my mind.</p>
