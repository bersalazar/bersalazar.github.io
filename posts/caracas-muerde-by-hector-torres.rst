A realistic and entertaining compilation of short stories which describe what people living in Caracas experience almost daily. Each story is portrayed with the city's colloquialism and with the moral background that constantly threatens to tear the citizens apart. It's done in a concise way, without unnecessary adjectives. Citizens of Caracas will relate with the overwhelming stories of violence, which are a part of a distorted culture.

Recommended read in Spanish.
