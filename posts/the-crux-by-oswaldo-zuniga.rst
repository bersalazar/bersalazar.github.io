I've followed Oswaldo's YouTube channel since I've started climbing. It's not straightforward to realize his philosophy and experiences, so this book was a nice surprise.

I found so much to relate to. Not only on his stories related to climbing, but from his relationships with immigration, death, mindfulness and failures.

Novice climbers like myself reference the pros and try to learn from them, which I find is not the most efficient way to progress. At this stage in my climbing path, I get pretty much the same experience and learning than the average non-climber person from watching an Adam Ondra video sending Silence or Alex Honnold's free soloing El Capitan. They're such highly technical climbs and the mental challenge so large, that it's very hard for me to take notice and learn anything. That's where guys like Oswaldo come in. They provide the substance that lowers the barrier of entry for amateurs and enthusiasts like me, who do this as a non-professional activity.

This book pours even more magic into that gap, as it covers not climbing techniques but the mental and philosophical aspects of practicing it, and its relationships with aspects of life.
