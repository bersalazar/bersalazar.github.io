Great storytelling with a concise plot that manages to cover many different subjects.

Desires, loyalty, compassion, fear, anger, discrimination and regret. Every character is richly developed.

Itâ€™s easy to follow their intentions and desires with few dialogues and a lot of subtext, even if their involvement within the story is short.
It does so with every chapter, starting with beautiful descriptions of the natural environment that surrounds them and later transitioning back to the main plot.

It's a tale of injustice prevailing even when hopes and dreams lie in small things.
