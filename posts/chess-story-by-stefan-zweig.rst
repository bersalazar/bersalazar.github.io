I was deeply impressed by this short story's capacity to take on multiple subjects on little text.

The remarkable part is its argument of how genius for a certain skill -chess in this case- can have its root in raw innate talent or as consequence of disciplined and frequent practice.

And in the case of the latter, as a side-effect of the process -detailed in a highly immersive section of the book- of white torture.
